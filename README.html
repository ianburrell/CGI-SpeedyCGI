<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make them
run much more quickly. A script can be made to to run persistently by
changing the interpreter line at the top of the script from:

<P>
<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/perl
</PRE>
<P>
to

<P>
<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/speedy
</PRE>
<P>
After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl interpreter
is kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is used to handle
new executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter each time. A very
fast frontend program, written in C, is executed for each request. This
fast frontend then contacts the persistent Perl process, which is usually
already running, to do the work and return the results.

<P>
By default each perl script runs in its own Unix process, so one perl
script can't interfere with another. Command line options can also be used
to deal with programs that have memory leaks or other problems that might
keep them from otherwise running persistently.

<P>
SpeedyCGI can be used to speed up perl CGI scripts. It conforms to the CGI
specification, and does not run perl code inside the web server. Since the
perl interpreter runs outside the web server, it can't cause problems for
the web server itself.

<P>
SpeedyCGI also provides an Apache module so that under the Apache web
server, scripts can be run without the overhead of doing a fork/exec for
each request. With this module a small amount of frontend code is run
within the web server - the perl interpreters still run outside the server.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="OPTIONS">OPTIONS</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Setting_Option_Values">Setting Option Values</A></H2>
<P>
SpeedyCGI options can be set in several ways:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Command">Command Line</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The speedy command line is the same as for regular perl, with the exception
that SpeedyCGI specific options can be passed in after a ``--''.

<P>
For example the line:

<P>
<PRE>        #!/usr/bin/speedy -w -- -t300
</PRE>
<P>
at the top of your script will set the perl option ``<CODE>-w</CODE>'' and will pass the ``<CODE>-t</CODE>'' option to SpeedyCGI, setting the Timeout value to 300 seconds.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Environment">Environment</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Environment variables can be used to pass in options. This can only be done
before the initial execution, not from within the script itself. The name
of the environment variable is always SPEEDY_ followed by the option name
in upper-case. For example to set the speedy Timeout option, use the
environment variable named SPEEDY_TIMEOUT.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Module">Module</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The CGI::SpeedyCGI module provides the setopt method to set options from
within the perl script at runtime. There is also a getopt method to
retrieve the current options. See <A HREF="#METHODS">METHODS</A> below.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Apache">Apache</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
If you are using the optional Apache module, SpeedyCGI options can be set
in the <EM>httpd.conf</EM> file. The name of the apache directive will always be Speedy followed by
the option name. For example to set the Timeout option, use the apache
directive SpeedyTimeout.

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Context">Context</A></H2>
<P>
Not all options below are available in all contexts. The context for which
each option is valid is listed on the ``Context'' line in the section
below. There are three contexts:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_speedy">speedy</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The command-line ``speedy'' program, used normally with #! at the top of
your script or from a shell prompt.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_mod_speedycgi">mod_speedycgi</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The optional Apache mod_speedycgi module.

        interpreters. If the group name is &quot;none&quot; then grouping is
        disabled and each interpreter will run one script.
        Different group names allow scripts to be separated into
        different groups. Name is case-sensitive, and only the
        first 12-characters are significant. Specifying an empty
        group name is the same as specifying the group name
        &quot;default&quot; - this allows just specifying &quot;-g&quot; on the command
        line to turn on grouping.

The following methods are available in the CGI::SpeedyCGI module.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_new">new</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Create a new CGI::SpeedyCGI object.

<P>
<PRE>    my $sp = CGI::SpeedyCGI-&gt;new;
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_register_cleanup">register_cleanup($function_ref)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Register a function that will be called at the end of each request, after
your script finishes running, but before STDOUT and STDERR are closed.
Multiple functions can be added by calling the method more than once. At
the end of the request, each function will be called in the order in which
it was registered.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;register_cleanup(\&amp;cleanup_func);
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_add_shutdown_handler">add_shutdown_handler($function_ref)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Add a function to the list of functions that will be called right before
the perl interpreter exits. This is <STRONG>not</STRONG> at the end of each request, it is when the perl interpreter decides to exit
completely due to a Timeout or reaching MaxRuns.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;add_shutdown_handler(sub {$dbh-&gt;logout});
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_set_shutdown_handler">set_shutdown_handler($function_ref)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Deprecated. Similar to <A HREF="#item_add_shutdown_handler">add_shutdown_handler</A>, but only allows for a single function to be registered.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;set_shutdown_handler(sub {$dbh-&gt;logout});
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_i_am_speedy">i_am_speedy</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Returns a boolean telling whether this script is running under SpeedyCGI or
not. A perl script can run under regular perl, or under SpeedyCGI. This
method allows the script to tell which environment it is in.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;i_am_speedy;
</PRE>
<P>
To make your script as portable as possible, you can use the following test
to make sure both the SpeedyCGI module is available and you are running
under SpeedyCGI:

<P>
<PRE>    if (eval {require CGI::SpeedyCGI} &amp;&amp; CGI::SpeedyCGI-&gt;i_am_speedy) {
        Do something SpeedyCGI specific here...
</PRE>
<P>
To increase the speed of this check you can also test whether the following
variable is defined instead of going through the object interface:

<P>
<PRE>    $CGI::SpeedyCGI::i_am_speedy
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_setopt">setopt($optname, $value)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Set one of the SpeedyCGI options given in <A HREF="#Options_Available">Options Available</A>. Returns the option's previous value. <CODE>$optname</CODE> is
case-insensitive.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;setopt('TIMEOUT', 300);
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_getopt">getopt($optname)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Return the current value of one of the SpeedyCGI options.
<CODE>$optname</CODE> is case-insensitive.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;getopt('TIMEOUT');
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_shutdown_now">shutdown_now</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Shut down the perl interpreter right away. This function does not return.

<P>
<PRE>    $sp-&gt;shutdown_now
</PRE>

for information on where to obtain the source code and binaries.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Binary_Installation">Binary Installation</A></H2>
<P>
Once you have downloaded the binary package for your OS, you'll need to
install it using the normal package tools for your OS. The commands to do
that are:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Linux">Linux</A></STRONG><DD>

If you are also installing the apache module you will have to configure
Apache as documented in <A HREF="#Apache_Configuration">Apache Configuration</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Source_Code_Installation">Source Code Installation</A></H2>
<P>
To compile SpeedyCGI you will need perl 5.004 or later, and a C compiler,
preferably the same one that your perl distribution was compiled with.
SpeedyCGI is known to work under Solaris, Redhat Linux, FreeBSD and
OpenBSD. There may be problems with other OSes or earlier versions of Perl.
SpeedyCGI may not work with threaded perl -- as of release 2.10, Linux and
Solaris seem to work OK with threaded perl, but FreeBSD does not.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Standard_Install">Standard Install</A></H2>
<P>
To do a standard install from source code, execute the following:

<P>
<PRE>    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</PRE>
<P>
This will install the speedy and speedy_backend binaries in the same
directory where perl was installed, and the SpeedyCGI.pm module in the
standard perl lib directory. It will also attempt to install the
mod_speedycgi module if you have the command <STRONG>apxs</STRONG> in your path.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Install_in_a_Different_Directory">Install in a Different Directory</A></H2>
<P>
If you don't have permission to install into the standard perl directory,
or if you want to install elsewhere, the easiest way is to compile and
install your own copy of perl in another location, then use your new
version of perl when you run ``perl Makefile.PL''. The SpeedyCGI binaries
and module will then be installed in the same location as the new version
of perl.

<P>
If you can't install your own perl, you can take the following steps:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Edit src/optdefs and change the default value for BackendProg to the
location where speedy_backend will be installed.

</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Compile as above, then manually copy the speedy and speedy_backend binaries
to where you want to install them.

</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
If you want to use the CGI::SpeedyCGI module in your code (it's not
required), you will have to use ``use lib'' so it can be located.

</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Apache_Installation">Apache Installation</A></H2>
<P>
To compile the optional apache mod_speedycgi module you must have the <STRONG>apxs</STRONG>
command in your path. Redhat includes this command with the
``apache-devel'' RPM, though it may not work properly for installation.

<P>
If the apache installation fails:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Copy the mod_speedycgi.so from the mod_speedycgi directory, or from the
mod_speedycgi2/.libs directory, to wherever your apache modules are stored
(try <EM>/usr/lib/apache</EM>)

</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Edit your <EM>httpd.conf</EM> (try <EM>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</EM>) and add the following lines. The path at the end of the LoadModule
directive may be different in your installation -- look at other
LoadModules to see.

<P>
<PRE>    LoadModule speedycgi_module modules/mod_speedycgi.so
</PRE>
<P>
If you are using Apache-1, also add:

<P>
<PRE>    AddModule mod_speedycgi.c
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Apache_Configuration">Apache Configuration</A></H2>

regular CGI. If you don't understand the security implications of the
changes below then don't make them.

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Path_Configuration">Path Configuration</A></STRONG>
<P>
This is similar to the way <EM>/cgi-bin</EM> works - everything under this path is handled by SpeedyCGI. Add the

accessed as <EM>/speedy/script-name</EM>.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_How">How does the speedy front end connect to the back end process?</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Via a Unix socket in <EM>/tmp</EM>. A queue is kept in a shared file in <EM>/tmp</EM>
that holds an entry for each process. In that queue are the pids of the
perl processes waiting for connections. The frontend pulls a process out of
this queue, connects to its socket, sends over the environment and argv,
and then uses this socket for stdin/stdout to the perl process.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_If">If another request comes in while SpeedyCGI script is running, does the client
have to wait or is another process started?  Is there a way to set a limit
on how many processes get started?</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
If another request comes while all the perl processes are busy, then
another perl process is started. Just like in regular perl there is
normally no limit on how many processes get started. But, the processes are
only started when the load is so high that they're necessary. If the load
goes down, the processes will die off due to inactivity, unless you disable
the timeout.

<P>
Starting in version 1.8.3 an option was added to limit the number of perl
backends running. See <STRONG>MaxBackends</STRONG> in <A HREF="#Options_Available">Options Available</A>
above.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>How much of perl's state is kept when speedy starts another request?
Do globals keep their values?  Are destructors run after the request?</STRONG><DD>
<P>
Globals keep their values. Nothing is destroyed after the request.
STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR are closed -- other files are not.  <CODE>%ENV</CODE> and <CODE>@ARGV</CODE>
are the only globals changed between requests.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>How can I make sure speedy restarts when I edit a perl library used
by the CGI?</STRONG><DD>
<P>
Do a touch on the main cgi file that is executed. The mtime on the main
file is checked each time the front-end runs.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Do">Do I need to be root to install and/or run SpeedyCGI?</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
No, root is not required.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>How can I determine if my perl app needs to be changed to work with
speedy?  Or is there no modification necessary?</STRONG><DD>
<P>
You may have to make modifications.

<P>
Globals retain their values between runs, which can be good for keeping
persistent database handles for example, or bad if your code assumes
they're undefined.

<P>
Also, if you create global variables with ``my'', you shouldn't try to
reference those variables from within a subroutine - you should pass them
into the subroutine instead. Or better yet just declare global variables
with ``use vars'' instead of ``my'' to avoid the problem altogether.

<P>
Here's a good explanation of the problem - it's for mod_perl, but the same
thing applies to speedycgi:

<P>
<PRE>    <A HREF="http://perl.apache.org/faq/mod_perl_cgi.html#Variables_retain_their_value_fro">http://perl.apache.org/faq/mod_perl_cgi.html#Variables_retain_their_value_fro</A>
</PRE>
<P>
If all else fails you can disable persistence by setting MaxRuns to 1. The
only benefit of this over normal perl is that speedy will pre-compile your
script.

</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>How do I keep a persistent connection to a database?</STRONG><DD>
<P>
Since globals retain their values between runs, the best way to do this is
to store the connection in a global variable, then check on each run to see
if that variable is already defined.

<P>
For example, if your code has an ``open_db_connection'' subroutine that
returns a database connection handle, you can use the code below to keep a
persistent connection:

<P>
<PRE>    use vars qw($dbh);
    unless (defined($dbh)) {
        $dbh = &amp;open_db_connection;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
This code will store a persistent database connection handle in the global
variable ``$dbh'' and only initialize it the first time the code is run.
During subsequent runs, the existing connection is re-used.

<P>
You may also want to check the connection each time before using it, in
case it is not working for some reason. So, assuming you have a subroutine
named ``db_connection_ok'' that returns true if the db connection is
working, you can use code like this:

<P>
<PRE>    use vars qw($dbh);
    unless (defined($dbh) &amp;&amp; &amp;db_connection_ok($dbh)) {
        $dbh = &amp;open_db_connection;
    }
</PRE>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Why">Why do scripts with persistent Oracle database connections hang?</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
When using an IPC connection to Oracle, an oracle process is fork'ed and
exec'ed and keeps the stdout connection open, so that the web server never
gets an EOF. To fix the problem, either switch to using a TCP connection to
the database, or add the following perl code somewhere before the
DBI-&gt;connect statement:

<P>
<PRE>    use Fcntl;
    fcntl(STDOUT, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC);
</PRE>
<P>
This will set the close-on-exec flag on standard out so it is closed when
oracle is exec'ed.

<H1><A NAME="USING_GROUPS">USING GROUPS</A></H1>
<P>
The group feature in SpeedyCGI can be used to help reduce the amount of
memory used by the perl interpreters. When groups are not used (ie when
group name is ``none''), each perl script is given its own set of perl
interpreters, separate from the perl interpreters used for other scripts.
In SpeedyCGI each perl interpreter is also a separate unix process.

<P>
When grouping is used, perl interpreters are put into a group. All perl
interpreters in that group can run perl scripts in that same group. What
this means is that by putting all your scripts into one group, there could
be one perl interpreter running all the perl scripts on your system. This
can greatly reduce your memory needs when running lots of different perl
scripts.

<P>
SpeedyCGI group names are entities unto themselves. They are not associated
with Unix groups, or with the Group directive in Apache. Group names are
created by the person running SpeedyCGI based on their needs. There are two
special group names ``none'' and ``default''. All other group names are
created by the user of SpeedyCGI using the Group option described in <A HREF="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</A>.

<P>
If you want to use the maximum amount of grouping possible (ie all scripts
in the same interpreter), then you should always use the group name
``default''. When you do this, you will get the fewest number of perl
interpreters possible. Each perl interpreter will be able to run any of
your perl scripts.

<P>
Although using group ``default'' for all scripts results in the most
efficient use of resources, it's not always possible or desirable to do
this. You may want to use other group names for the following reasons:

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_To">To isolate misbehaving scripts, or scripts that don't work in groups.</A></STRONG>
<P>
Some scripts cannot work in groups. When perl scripts are grouped together
they are each given their own unique package name - they are not run out of
the ``main'' package as they normally would be. So, for example, a script
that explicitly uses ``main'' somewhere in its code to find its subroutines
or variables probably won't work in groups. In this case, it's probably
best to run such a script with group ``none'', so it is compiled and run
out of package main, and always given its own interpreter.

<P>
Other scripts may make changes to included packages, etc, that may break
other scripts running in the same interpreter. In this case such scripts
can be given their own group name (like group name ``pariah'') to keep them
away from other scripts that they are incompatible with. The rest of your
scripts can then run out of group ``default''. This will ensure that the
``pariah'' scripts won't run within the same interpreter as your other
scripts.

</UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_To">To pass different perl or SpeedyCGI parameters to different scripts.</A></STRONG>
<P>
The first script to start up in a group sets the perl and SpeedyCGI
parameters used from then on for all scripts in that group. You may want to
use separate groups to create separate policies for different scripts.

<P>
Say you have an email application that contains ten perl scripts, and since
the common perl code used in this application has a bad memory leak, you
want to user a MaxRuns setting of 5 for all of these scripts. You then want
all your other scripts to run in a separate group with a normal MaxRuns
policy. What you can do is edit the ten email scripts, and at the top, put
in the line:

<P>
<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/speedy -- -gmail -r5
</PRE>
<P>
In the rest of your perl scripts you can use:

<P>
<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/speedy -- -g
</PRE>
<P>
What this will do is put the ten email scripts into a group of their own
(named ``mail'') and give them all the default MaxRuns value of 5. All
other scripts will be put into the group named ``default'', and this group
will have the normal MaxRuns setting.
