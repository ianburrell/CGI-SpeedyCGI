letter	r
defval	500
context	all
desc	Once the perl interpreter has run <number> times, re-exec the
desc    backend process.  Zero indicates no maximum.  This option is useful
desc	for processes that tend to consume resources over time.

option	MaxBackends
type	whole
defval	0
defdesc	no max
letter	M
context	frontend
desc	If non-zero, limits the number of speedy backends running for this
desc	perl script to <number>.

option	BackendProg
type	str
letter	p
context	frontend
defval	$INSTALLBIN/speedy_backend
desc	Path to the speedy backend program.

option	TmpBase
type	str
letter	T
defval	/tmp/speedy
context	frontend
desc	Use the given prefix for creating temporary files.  This must be
desc	a filename prefix, not a directory name.

option	PerlArgs
type	str
context mod_speedycgi
desc	Command-line options to pass to the perl interpreter.

option	BufsizPost
type	natural
letter	b
context	speedy
defval	131072
desc	Use <number> bytes as the maximum size for the buffer that sends
desc	data to the perl backend.

option	BufsizGet
type	natural
letter	B
context	speedy
defval	131072
desc	Use <number> bytes as the maximum size for the buffer that receives
desc	data from the perl backend.

option  BECheckTimeout
type	natural
defval	1
desc	The frontend waits <number> seconds before waking up and checking for
desc	dead backends.

option	RestatTimeout
type	natural
defval	5
desc	The frontend re-stats the perl-script this often while waiting for
desc	a backend.  Also used as a timeout for re-opening the temp-file.

option	BESpawns
type	natural
defval	1
desc	The frontend can spawn this many backends simultaneously when there
desc	are frontends waiting for backends.  More may not be better.

option	Version
type	toggle
letter	v
context	speedy
desc	Print the SpeedyCGI version and exit.

option	Group
type	str
letter	g
context	frontend
defval	none
desc	Allow a single perl interpreter to run multiple scripts.
desc	All scripts that are run with the same group name and by the same user
desc	will be run by the same group of perl interpreters.
desc	If the group name is "none" then grouping is disabled and each
desc	interpreter will run one script.
desc	Different group names allow scripts to be separated into
desc	different groups.
desc	Name is case-sensitive, and only the first 12-characters are
desc	significant.
desc	Specifying an empty group name is the same as specifying
desc	the group name "default" - this allows just specifying "-g"
desc	on the command line to turn on grouping.
