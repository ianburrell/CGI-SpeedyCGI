Revision history for Perl extension CGI::SpeedyCGI.

1.7  Thu May 13 00:28:42 PDT 1999

	- Re-did a lot of the queue.c code.  Fixes the bug where queue
	  order was not being preserved when a perl-proc exited.  Also
	  saves a couple syscalls when using read/write instead of mmap.

	- Fixed compile warnings on Dec Alpha in start_perl.c and 
	  speedy.c

	- Added "sleep 2" to fix t/basic.t test #2 under HP-UX.

	- Secret word was not very random on little-endian systems.


1.6  Sun Apr  4 18:18:25 PDT 1999

	- added support for stderr.

	- make sure to cd back to original directory after each perl run.

	- signals are now reset between every request.

	- wrote speedy_poll.c -- allows compilation for
	  either poll or select, using defines USE_POLL or USE_SELECT.
	  Default is poll for sysv & sun, select for all others.

	- queue.c patch for compile failure on alpha/OSF1 V3.2. 
	  From Jean-Damien Durand <jdurand@mail.cern.ch>

	- Use mtime instead of ctime to check whether a file has changed.
	  Touch doesn't reliably update ctime on some systems.

	- Send over environment using the same poll loop as when sending
	  stdin/stdout.  A little cleaner & more efficient.


1.5  Tue Mar 30 13:33:55 PST 1999

	- Re-wrote the test scripts to be more reliable.

	- Added a FAQ file.


1.4  Mon Mar 29 03:54:39 PST 1999

	- Converted C++ style comments to /**/.  Should help compilation

	- Added CGI::SpeedyCGI::set_shutdown_handler to allow the perl
	  program to set a callback for when perl is shut down.

	- Added t/shutdown.t to test the new set_shutdown_handler feature.

	- queue.c wouldn't compile as-is on Solaris Devpro-4.2.  Changed
	  the void*'s to char*'s so the compiler could do pointer arithmetic.
