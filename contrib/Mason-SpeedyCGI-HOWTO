Mason Speedy CGI - HOWTO

This is a Mini HOWTO on how to run Speedy CGI with Mason at
http://www.masonhq.com

The problem is that the instructions that are included with Mason
require that you install mod_perl.  Running mod_perl as a module with
Mason on a Redhat system won't work, so you need to create a
statically linked Apache-mod_perl.  This is painful.

The following is a much easier way to run Mason

1) Install Speedy CGI

2) Install HTML::Mason

3) Put the mason.cgi file in your cgi-bin directory, MAKE SURE THAT YOU
   MODIFY THE FILE FIRST.

4) Add the following line to your /etc/httpd/etc/httpd.conf

  ScriptAlias /mason/ /home/httpd/cgi-bin/mason.cgi/

5) (Optional) change your directory index to look like

  DirectoryIndex mason/index.html index.html  (etc. etc. etc.)
  
A *whole* lot less painful than installing mod_perl.

TODO

The next project I am working on is to get SpeedyCGI to work with
Slashdot.
